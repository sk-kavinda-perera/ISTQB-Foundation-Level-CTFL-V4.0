## 1. Fundamentals OF Testing v4.0

### 1.1 Why Testing is necessay?
Software applications are everywhere and have become an important part of our lives. Each of us has used software in some way. We use software on our phones through apps, in hospital machines, business applications, in the stock market, and for entertainment.

Due to defects or bugs, many software applications can fail or fail to meet the needs of stakeholders. Software that doesn't work properly, or even has minor issues, can lead to significant problems and frustrations.

Even small mistakes in software can lead to significant financial losses and damage a company's reputation. In some cases, they can even result in injury or death.

For example:

In 1996, a rocket crashed just 30 seconds after launch. Upon investigation, it was found that a single software error caused the software to fail, which in turn led to the hardware malfunctioning and the rocket crashing. The issue was traced back to a software bug.
Boeing's solution to the problem was to release a software upgrade for its grounded 737 Max aircraft to address the issue.
Our goal should always be to create stable, functional software. Based on experience, no issue in software should be considered minor.

From a project management perspective, testing is essential because every project has scope, time, budget, and quality constraints. We must release the product as specified in the requirements document, which defines the scope, on a specific date, without exceeding the budget, and within the established quality standards.

**Testing, as a form of quality control , helps achieve the agreed-upon goals within the set scope, time, quality and budget constraints.**

**Testing should not be limited to the test team. Any stakeholder can use their testing skills to bring the project closer to success. Testing components, systems, and associated documentation helps identify defects in the software.**
